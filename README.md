## Introduction
Human's desire to seek information is the driving force of social progress. With the development of society, the Internet has become the best social tool to connect people, thus gaining the favor of more teenagers. Social media has provided a lot of convenience in the life of teenagers, it can help users get information more easily and shorten the distance between users.But we found that social media use exacerbated teen-family conflict. Digital media fills teens' spare time, including video games, web surfing and online social networking. Overall, teens' over-reliance on social media had more negative effects than positive effects on family relationships.
Therefore, our team aims to design and develop a youth anti-addiction app called "REBOND" based on human-centered design principles. To help teenagers between the ages of 10 and 12 not addicted to the use of social media. The 'REBOND' app, which enables parents of teens to monitor their electronic devices remotely, plays a role in helping parents monitor teens' social media usage. Teens can only browse social media within the time limit set by their parents, and if the time limit is exceeded, the system will force-exit social media. The app is designed to prevent teens from misusing social media and its possible negative impact on families.
For the design of this application, our team needs to first arrange the functions of the product and the required pages, and then design a low-fidelity prototype based on the product's infographic, followed by user testing. Interaction and interface design are iterated. Finally, design a high-fidelity prototype based on the iterative prototype, and conduct further user testing and prototype iteration based on the high-fidelity prototype. We hope that through the design of the app, the tension between teens and their parents, which has been exacerbated by the use of social media, can finally be resolved, and the family atmosphere will be more harmonious and friendly.
